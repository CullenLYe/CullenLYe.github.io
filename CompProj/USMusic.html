<b style="font-family: helvetica">Yankee Doodle</b><br>
by George Alexander<br>
<audio controls>

This song was originally written by Richard Shuckburgh, a British army surgeon, in 1755 to mock the American colonists during the French and Indian War.<br>
During the American Revolution, however, the Americans adopted it and proudly sung it with national pride.<br><br>
<u>Lyrics:</u>
<font size="3"><pre>
Yankee Doodle went to town,
Riding on a pony,
Stuck a feather in his hat
And called it macaroni.
Yankee Doodle keep it up,
Yankee Doodle dandy.
Mind the music and the step,
And with the girls be handy.
Father and I went down to camp,
Along with Captain Gooding,
And there we saw the men and boys
As thick as hasty pudding.
Yankee Doodle keep it up,
Yankee Doodle dandy.
Mind the music and the step,
And with the girls be handy.
And there was General Washington
Upon a slapping stallion,
A-giving orders to his men.
I guess there was a million.
Yankee Doodle keep it up,
Yankee Doodle dandy.
Mind the music and the step,
And with the girls be handy.
A long war then we fought and won,
The British were defeated,
And Yankee Doodle was the march
To which their troops retreated.
Yankee Doodle keep it up,
Yankee Doodle dandy.
Mind the music and the step,
And with the girls be handy.

This was essentially a Union diss track to the Confederacy (Dixie), written as a parody of the Confederacy's song, "Dixie".<br><br>
<u>Lyrics:</u>
<font size="3"><pre>
Away down South in the land of traitors,
Rattlesnakes and alligators,
Right away, Come away,
Right away, Come away.
Where cotton's king and men are chattels,
Union boys will win the battles,
Right away, Come away,
Right away, Come away.
We'll all go down to Dixie, Away! Away!
Each Dixie boy must understand
That he must mind his Uncle Sam.
Away! Away! We'll all go down to Dixie!
Away! Away! We'll all go down to Dixie!
I wish I was in Baltimore.
I'd make secession traitors roar,
Right away, Come away,
Right away, Come away.
We'll put the traitors all to rout.
I'll bet my boots we'll whip them out.
Right away, Come away,
Right away, Come away.
We'll all go down to Dixie, Away! Away!
Each Dixie boy must understand
That he must mind his Uncle Sam.
Away! Away! We'll all go down to Dixie!
Away! Away! We'll all go down to Dixie!
Oh, may our stars and stripes still wave
Forever o'er the free and brave.
Right away, Come away,
Right away, Come away.
And let our motto ever be:
"For Union and for liberty".
Right away, Come away
Right away, Come away.
We'll all go down to Dixie, Away! Away!
Each Dixie boy must understand
That he must mind his Uncle Sam.
Away! Away! We'll all go down to Dixie!
Away! Away! We'll all go down to Dixie!

This song, written by James Greenleaf in 1861, is praising John Brown, an abolitionist martyr who led an armed slave rebellion.<br><br>
<u>Lyrics:</u>
<font size="3"><pre>
John Brown's body lies moldering in the grave.
John Brown's body lies moldering in the grave.
John Brown's body lies moldering in the grave,
But his soul goes marching on.
Glory, glory hallelujah!
Glory, glory hallelujah!
Glory, glory hallelujah!
But his soul goes marching on.
The stars above in heaven are looking kindly down.
The stars above in heaven are looking kindly down.
The stars above in heaven are looking kindly down
On the grave of ol' John Brown.
Glory, glory hallelujah!
Glory, glory hallelujah!
Glory, glory hallelujah!
His soul goes marching on.
He captured Harpers Ferry with his nineteen men so true.
He frightened ol' Virginia till she trembled through and through.
They hanged him for a traitor, they themselves the traitor crew.
His soul goes marching on.
Glory, glory hallelujah!
Glory, glory hallelujah!
Glory, glory hallelujah!
His soul goes marching on.
Well he's gone to be a soldier in the army of the Lord.
He's gone to be a soldier in the army of the Lord.
He's gone to be a soldier in the army of the Lord,
But his soul goes marching on.
Glory, glory hallelujah!
Glory, glory hallelujah!
Glory, glory hallelujah!
His soul goes marching on.
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored.
He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword.
His truth is marching on.
Glory, glory hallelujah!
Glory, glory hallelujah!
Glory, glory hallelujah!
His soul goes marching on.

Julia Ward Howe, an abolitionist, originally wrote this song in 1861 using the music of <i>John Brown's Body</i>.<br>
In it, she connects God's judgement as described in the Bible to the ongoing American Civil War.<br><br>
<u>Lyrics:</u>
<font size="3"><pre>
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored.
He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword.
His truth is marching on.
Glory, glory hallelujah!
Glory, glory hallelujah!
Glory, glory hallelujah!
His truth is marching on.
I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps.
They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps.
I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps.
His day is marching on.
Glory, glory hallelujah!
Glory, glory hallelujah!
Glory, glory hallelujah!
His truth is marching on.
I have read a fierty gospel writ in burnished rows of steel:
"As ye deal with my contemners, so with you my grace shall deal".
Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with His heel,
Since God is marching on.
Glory, glory hallelujah!
Glory, glory hallelujah!
Glory, glory hallelujah!
His truth is marching on.
He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat.
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgement seat.
Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him. Be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.
Glory, glory hallelujah!
Glory, glory hallelujah!
Glory, glory hallelujah!
Our God is marching on.
In the beauty of the lilies, Christ was born across the sea,
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me.
As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free,
His truth is marching on.
Glory, glory hallelujah!
Glory, glory hallelujah!
Glory, glory hallelujah!
His truth is marching on.

The Battle Cry of Freedom was written in 1862 by George Frederick Root during the American Civil War.<br>
It explains and promotes the causes of the Union and abolitionism.<br><br>
<u>Lyrics:</u>
<font size="3"><pre>
Oh we'll rally around the flag, boys, rally once again,
Shouting the battle cry of freedom!
We will rally from the hillside,
We'll gather from the plain,
Shouting the battle cry of freedom!
The Union forever! Hurrah, boys, hurrah!
Down with the traitor, up with the star,
While we rally around the flag, boys, rally once again,
Shouting the battle cry of freedom!
We are springing to the call of our brothers gone before,
Shouting the battle cry of freedom!
And we'll fill the vacant ranks with a million freed men more,
Shouting the battle cry of freedom!
The Union forever! Hurrah, boys, hurrah!
Down with the traitor, up with the star,
While we rally around the flag, boys, rally once again,
Shouting the battle cry of freedom!
We will welcome to our numbers, the loyal, true, and brave,
Shouting the battle cry of freedom!
And although they may be poor, not a man shall be a slave,
Shouting the battle cry of freedom!
The Union forever! Hurrah, boys, hurrah!
Down with the traitor, up with the star,
While we rally around the flag, boys, rally once again,
Shouting the battle cry of freedom!
So we're springing to the call from the east and from the west,
Shouting the battle cry of freedom!
And we'll hurl the rebel crew from the land we love the best,
Shouting the battle cry of freedom!
The Union forever! Hurrah, boys, hurrah!
Down with the traitor, up with the star,
While we rally around the flag, boys, rally once again,
Shouting the battle cry of freedom!
While we rally around the flag, boys, rally once again,
Shouting the battle cry of freedom!

<u>Lyrics:</u>
<font size="3"><pre>
When Johnny comes marching home again, Hurrah! Hurrah!
We'll give him a hearty welcome then, Hurrah! Hurrah!
Oh, the men will cheer and the boys will shout.
The ladies they will all turn out.
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home.
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home.
Get ready for the Jubilee, Hurrah! Hurrah!
We'll give the hero three times three, Hurrah! Hurrah!
Well, the laurel wreath is ready now
To place upon his loyal brow.
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home.
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home.
In eighteen hundred and sixty one, Hurrah! Hurrah!
That was when the war begun, Hurrah! hurrah!
In eighteen hundred and sixty two, 
Both sides were falling to.
And we'll all drink stone wine when Johnny comes marching home.
And we'll all drink stone wine when Johnny comes marching home.
In eighteen hundred and sixty three, Hurrah! Hurrah!
Old Abe, he ended slavery, Hurrah! Hurrah!
In eighteen hundred and sixty three,
Old Abe, he ended slavery.
And we'll all drink stone wine when Johnny comes marching home.
And we'll all drink stone wine when Johnny comes marching home.
In eighteen hundred and sixty four, Hurrah! Hurrah!
Abe called for five hundred thousand more, Hurrah! Hurrah!
In eighteen hundred and sixty five,
They talked rebellion, strife.
And we'll all drink stone wine when Johnny comes marching home.
And we'll all drink stone wine when Johnny comes marching home.

This marching song was written by Henry Clay Work in 1865, near the end of the American Civil War.<br>
It dictates how Union General William T. Sherman absolutely <i>destroyed</i> the Confederacy, freeing slaves and implementing a scorched-earth policy.<br><br>
<u>Lyrics:</u>
<font size="3"><pre>
Bring the good old bugle, boys, we'll sing another song,
Sing it with a spirit that will start the world along.
Sing it as we used to sing it, fifty thousand strong,
While we were marching through Georgia.
Hurrah! Hurrah! We bring the jubilee!
Hurrah! Hurrah! The flag that makes you free!
So we sang the chorus from Atlanta to the sea,
While we were marching through Georgia.
There were many Union men who wept with joyful tears
When they saw the honored flag they had not seen for years.
Hardly could they be restrained from breaking forth in cheers,
While we were marching through Georgia.
Hurrah! Hurrah! We bring the jubilee!
Hurrah! Hurrah! The flag that makes you free!
So we sang the chorus from Atlanta to the sea,
While we were marching through Georgia.
So we made a thoroughfare for freedom and her train,
Sixty miles in latitude, three hundred to the main.
Treason fled before us, for resistance was in vain,
While we were marching through Georgia.
Hurrah! Hurrah! We bring the jubilee!
Hurrah! Hurrah! The flag that makes you free!
So we sang the chorus from Atlanta to the sea,
While we were marching, while we were marching, while we were marching
Through Georgia!

Oh beautiful for pilgrim feet, whose stern impassioned stress
A thoroughfare for freedom beat across the wilderness!
America! America! God mend thine every flaw.
Confirm thy soul in self-control, thy liberty in law.
Oh beautiful for heroes proved in liberating strife,
Who more than self their country loved and mercy more than life.
America! America! May God thy gold refine,
Till all success be nobleness and every gain divine.
Oh beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years.
Thine alabaster cities gleam undimmed by human tears.
America! America! God shine His grace on thee
And crown thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea!

Johnny get your gun, get your gun, get your gun.
Take it on the run, on the run, on the run.
Hear them calling you and me, every Son of Liberty.
Hurry right away, no delay, go today.
Make your daddy glad to have had such a lad.
Tell your sweetheart not to pine,
To be proud her boy's in line.
Over there! over there!
Send the word, send the word, over there.
That the Yanks are coming! The Yanks are coming!
The drums rum-tumming everywhere.
So prepare, say a prayer.
Send the word, send the word, to beware.
We'll be over, we're coming over,
And we won't come back until it's over, over there.
Over there! over there!
Send the word, send the word, over there.

Johnny get your gun, get your gun, get your gun.
Johnny show the Hun you're a son of a gun.
Hoist the flag and let her fly.
Yankee Doodle do or die.
Pack your little kit, show your grit, do your bit.
Yankee to the ranks from the towns and the tanks.
Make your mother proud of you
And the old red, white, and blue.
Over there! over there!
Send the word, send the word, over there.
That the Yanks are coming! The Yanks are coming!
The drums rum-tumming everywhere.
So prepare, say a prayer.

Woody Guthrie wrote this piece in 1940 simply because he disliked the song "God Bless America" by Irving Berlin.<br><br>
<u>Lyrics:</u>
<font size="3"><pre>
This land is your land, and this land is my land.
From California to the New York island.
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf stream waters,
This land was made for you and me.
As I went walking that ribbon of highway
And I saw above me, that endless skyway,
I saw below me, that golden valley.
This land was made for you and me.
I roamed and rambled and followed my footsteps
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts,
And all around me, a voice was sounding:
"This land was made for you and me."
There was a big high wall there that tried to stop me.
A sign was painted, said "Private Property",
But on the backside it didn't say nothing.
This land was made for you and me.
When the sun come shining, then I was strolling
In wheat fields waving and dust clouds rolling.
The voice was chanting as the fog was lifting:
"This land was made for you and me."
This land is your land, and this land is my land.
From California to the New York island.
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf stream waters,
This land was made for you and me.

Written by Marty Robbins in 1966, this is an example of capitalist propaganda criticizing communism.<br>
This was also written in response to the United States interfering in Vietnam in 1965.<br><br>
<u>Lyrics:</u>
<font size="3"><pre>
You came down to this southern town last summer
To show the folks a brand new way of life.
But all you've shown the folks around here is trouble,
And you've only added misery to their strife.
Your concern is not to help the people,
And I'll say again, though it's been often said.
Your concern is just to bring discomfort, my friend,
And your policy is just a little red.
Now, ain't I right?
It matters not to you how people suffer,
And should they, you'd consider that a gain.
You bring a lot of trouble to the town and then you leave.
That's part of your communistic game.
I detect a little communism.
I can see it in the things you do.
Communism, socialism, call it what you like.
There's very little difference in the two.
Now, ain't I right?
Your followers sometimes have been a bearded, batless bunch.
There's even been a minister or two.
A priest, a nun, a rabbi, and an educated man
Have listened and been taken in by you.
Aw, the country's full of two-faced politicians
Who encourage you with words that go like this:
"Burn your draft card if you like, it's good to disagree."
That's a get acquainted communistic kiss.
Now, ain't I right?
One politician said it would be nice to send some blood
And help the enemy in Vietnam.
That's what he says, here's what I say:
Let's just keep the blood.
Instead, let's send that politician man.
Let's rid the country of the politicians,
Who call us tramps, that march out in our streets.
Protesting those who wanna fight for freedom, my friend.
This kind of leader makes our country weak.
Now, ain't I right?
Let's look and find the strong and able leaders.
It's time we found just how our neighbors stand.
If we're to win this war with communism,
Let's fight it here as well as Vietnam.
Let's rise as one and meet our obligations,
So communistic boots will never trod
Across the fields of freedom that were given to us
With the blessing of our great almighty God.
Across the fields of freedom that were given to us
With the blessing of our great almighty God.

Amidst controversy concerning Nixon's policies regarding the Vietnam War, Johnny Cash wrote this single in 1974 to restore faith in the goodness of America and its people.<br>
The song tells a narrative story through poetic speaking with background music, but is still considered a song.<br><br>
<u>Lyrics:</u>
<font size="3"><pre>
I walked through a county courthouse square.
On a park bench, an old man was sitting there.
I said, your old courthouse is kinda run down.
He said, naw, it'll do for our little town.
I said, your old flagpole has leaned a little bit,
And that's a ragged old flag you got hanging on it.
He said, have a seat, and I sat down.
Is this the first time you've been to our little town?
I said, I think it is.
He said, I don't like to brag,
But we're kinda proud of that ragged old flag.
You see, we got a little hole in that flag there 
When Washington took it across the Delaware,
And it got powder-burned the night Francis Scott Key
Sat watching it writing "Say Can You See".
And it got a bad rip in New Orleans
With Packingham and Jackson tuggin' at its seams,
And it almost fell at the Alamo
Beside the Texas flag, but she waved on though.
She got cut with a sword at Chancellorsville,
And she got cut again at Shiloh Hill.
There was Robert E. Lee, Beauregard, and Bragg,
And the south wind blew hard on that ragged old flag.
On Flanders Field in World War One,
She got a big hole from a Bertha gun.
She turned blood red in World War Two.
She hung limp and low a time or two.
She was in Korea and Vietnam.
She went where she was sent by her Uncle Sam.
She waved from our ships upon the briny foam,
And now they've about quit waving her back here at home.
In her own good land here, she's been abused.
She's been burned, dishonored, denied, and refused,
And the government for which she stands
Is scandalized throughout the land.
And she's getting threadbare and she's wearing thin,
But she's in good shape for the shape she's in.
Cause she's been through the fire before,
And I believe she can take a whole lot more.
So we raise her up every morning.
We take her down every night.
We don't let her touch the ground and we fold her up right.
On second thought, I do like to brag,
Cause I'm mighty proud of that ragged old flag.

If tomorrow all the things were gone, I worked for all my life,

And they can't take that away.
And I'm proud to be an American, where at least I know I'm free.
And I won't forget the men who died, who gave that right to me.
And I gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today.
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land.
God bless the U.S.A.!
From the lakes of Minnesota to the lakes of Tennessee,
Across the plains of Texas, from sea to shining sea,
From Detroit down to Houston, and New York to L.A.,
Where there's pride in every American heart,
And it's time we stand and say:
That I'm proud to be an American, where at least I know I'm free.
And I won't forget the men who died, who gave that right to me.
And I gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today.
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land.
God bless the U.S.A.!
